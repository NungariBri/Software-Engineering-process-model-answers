4.1 Provide three examples of software projects that would be amenable to the waterfall model. Be specific.

(Answer:)Since in this model requirements don’t change, the following examples are suitable to this model
(e.g.; 1. when registering for national ID, requirements for this are fixed by law so here the steps can follow one another 
       2.An ATM software has a fixed system with the function of withdrawal, check balance, deposit and of which all these are            fixed and follow a strict process.  
 4.2. Provide three examples of software projects that would be amenable to the prototyping model. Be specific.

(Answer:)1.This model can be appropriate when creating shopping apps; users are able to interact with the app and give a  feedback once they interact with the mock version of which afterwards they may give their suggestions
         2.mobile app for campus activities—students need to test features like posting or chat before finalizing
4.4. Provide three examples of software projects that would be amenable to the incremental model. Be specific. 

(Answer:)1.Example, a campus marketplace app. Instead of waiting for months, years to finish everything like putting products, services, payment methods, reviews etc., until “the big launch”,  You first release a basic version, one that is                maybe doing one or two of this functionalities e.g., service and product lists….once that is working, in the next               release you add payment methods like Mpesa payments, later on you add ratings, reviews then maybe location for                  tracking.
         2.Another example would be the learning management system used here in campus; first the courses/units are released,             learning progresses, CATs and examinations are given then grading.
         3.Thirdly, there is the library system; we begin implementing the with borrowing and returning of books, then fines               for overdue books are added, later on the E-library made, where students can access materials online.
4.5. As you move outward along the spiral process flow, what can you say about the software that is being developed or maintained?

(Answer:) Moving outward along the spiral process flow means adding detail,reducing risks and getting closer to deployment. firstly, the inner loops focus on rough prototypes and here the goal is to just explore ideas, check feasibility and reduce risk. the moddle loops deal with adding core functionality, outer loops deal with almost complete products where more advanced features are added and what we call Final outer loop delivers a ready system that is deployed. The outward growth shows the system becoming becoming more complete with each loop.

4.6. Is it possible to combine process models? If so, provide an example. 

(Answer:) Yes, let’s look at a health tracking app for example; in its making, a prototype is made that tests the look and feel...then incremental model for adding new features like sleep tracking, diet tracking, step count etc.
