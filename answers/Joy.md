ANSWERS
4.1 
- Libarary Management System, since it requires functions that will be consistent during use making their requirements quite stable and are unlikely to change once agreed upon
- Hospital Patient Record System, hospital require a structured data, the requirements which are: storing personal data, medical history and billing are stable and well documented hence there will be minimal to no changes which is makes waterfall model favourable.
- Banking transaction processing system, the bank requires features like deposit withdraw and fund transfer maybe even balance inquiry. Since it has fixed requirements with little to no changes the waterfall model is recommendable.
4.3
- The prototype must follow the coding standards and good design principles to improve the quality standards
- The requirements, design and test acses must be documented, proper documentation.
- The prototype code must be cleaned up and optimised for maintainability.
- It should be conducted thorough testing before the release
4.4
- Social Media app, where the first increment would be a platform where a user can create a profile and can post then later on the app is updated and messaging, video calls and grouping is added
4.5
As one moves outwrd along the spiral:
- The software becomes more complete and detailed
- Each loop adds more functionality and reduces risks
- Inner loops are usually early planning and prototpes.
- Outer loops are usually fully functional, tested and deployed.
4.6
- Yes, process models can be combined for example: A company may use prototyping to clarify unclear user requirements, then switch to waterfall for structured development once the requirements are stable.
4.7
- In concurrent model each software activity can exist in different states such as:
Not started- no work is being done or has started
Under development- work is being done
Awaiting changes- waiting to be worked on
Done/Baselined- completed
- These states show the current progress of each activity and allows multiple activities to overlap
- Ex: requirements marked complete but later during design a conflict was found in requirements, the requirments are rendered awaiting changes.
4.8
Advantages:
- Useful when deadlines are critical
- Lower development cost
Disadvantages:
- Higher maintainance cost
- Can be risky for safety critical systems
4.10
- For large systems it may be impractical but may work for small programs.
- Frequent requirement changes may make the existing correctness proofs obsolete
- Specialised skills are needed since deep mathematical and formal logic expertise.
- It is usually of high costs and requires so much time.
4.11
- No, Unified process is a software development process framework(how to build a software) while Unified Modeling Language is a visual modeling language used to represent software design using diagrams. UML can be used within UP but they are different thinngs, one is a process while the other is a notation.
