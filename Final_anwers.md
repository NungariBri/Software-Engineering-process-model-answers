## Discussion Questions and Answers

### 4.1 Provide three examples of software projects that would be amenable to the waterfall model. Be specific.

**Answer:**

* Library Management System: requires consistent functions, stable requirements unlikely to change.
* Hospital Patient Record System: structured data such as personal info, medical history, billing are stable and well-documented.
* Banking Transaction Processing System: fixed features like deposit, withdrawal, fund transfer, and balance inquiry make it suitable for waterfall.

### 4.2 Provide three examples of software projects that would be amenable to the prototyping model. Be specific.

**Answer:**

---

### 4.3 What process adaptations are required if the prototype will evolve into a delivery system or product?

**Answer:**

* The prototype must follow coding standards and good design principles.
* Requirements, design, and test cases must be documented properly.
* Prototype code must be cleaned up and optimized for maintainability.
* Thorough testing should be conducted before release.

### 4.4 Provide three examples of software projects that would be amenable to the incremental model. Be specific.

**Answer:**

* Social Media App: first increment allows users to create profiles and post. Later increments add messaging, video calls, and group features.

### 4.5 As you move outward along the spiral process flow, what can you say about the software that is being developed or maintained?

**Answer:**

* The software becomes more complete and detailed.
* Each loop adds more functionality and reduces risks.
* Inner loops are usually early planning and prototypes.
* Outer loops are usually fully functional, tested, and deployed.

---

### 4.6 Is it possible to combine process models? If so, provide an example.

**Answer:**

* Yes. For example, a company may use prototyping to clarify unclear user requirements, then switch to waterfall for structured development once requirements are stable.

---

### 4.7 The concurrent process model defines a set of “states.” Describe what these states represent in your own words, and then indicate how they come into play within the concurrent process model.

**Answer:**

* Each activity can exist in different states:

  * Not started: no work has begun.
  * Under development: work is ongoing.
  * Awaiting changes: waiting for updates.
  * Done/Baselined: completed.
* These states show current progress and allow multiple activities to overlap.
* Example: requirements marked complete but later during design a conflict is found, moving requirements back to “awaiting changes.”

### 4.8 What are the advantages and disadvantages of developing software in which quality is “good enough”? That is, what happens when we emphasize development speed over product quality?

**Answer:**
**Advantages:**

* Useful when deadlines are critical.
* Lower development cost.

**Disadvantages:**

* Higher maintenance cost.
* Risky for safety-critical systems.

---

### 4.9 Provide three examples of software projects that would be amenable to the component-based model. Be specific.

**Answer:**

---

### 4.10 It is possible to prove that a software component and even an entire program is correct. So why doesn’t everyone do this?

**Answer:**

* For large systems it is impractical, though it may work for small programs.
* Frequent requirement changes can make existing correctness proofs obsolete.
* Specialized skills are needed, requiring deep mathematical and formal logic expertise.
* Very high cost and time-consuming.

### 4.11 Are the Unified Process and UML the same thing? Explain your answer.

**Answer:**

* No. Unified Process is a software development process framework (how to build software), while Unified Modeling Language is a visual modeling language used to represent software design with diagrams. UML can be used within UP, but they are different things: one is a process, the other is a notation.
