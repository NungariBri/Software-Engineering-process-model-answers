                             DISCUSSION QNS:
   4.1. Provide three examples of software projects that would be amenable to the waterfall model. Be specific. 
   
   4.2.  Provide three examples of software projects that would be amenable to the prototyping model. Be specific.

   4.3.  What process adaptations are required if the prototype will evolve into a delivery system or product?  

   4.4.  Provide three examples of software projects that would be amenable to the incremental model. Be specific.  

   4.5.  As you move outward along the spiral process fl ow, what can you say about the software that is being developed or maintained? 

   4.6.  Is it possible to combine process models? If so, provide an example. 

   4.7.  The concurrent process model defi nes a set of “states.” Describe what these states represent in your own words, and then indicate 
         how they come into play within the concurrent process model. 

   4.8.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of developing software in which quality is “good enough”? That is, what happens when we 
         emphasize development speed over product quality? 

   4.9.  Provide three examples of software projects that would be amenable to the component-based model. Be specific.  

   4.10.  It is possible to prove that a software component and even an entire program is correct. So why doesn’t everyone do this? 

   4.11.  Are the Unifi ed Process and UML the same thing? Explain your answer.
